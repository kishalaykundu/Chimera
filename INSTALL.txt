Chimera uses Cmake system to configure and build the simulation framework.

NOTE: ALL SCRIPTS MUST BE RUN IN THE PROJECT FOLDER

This installation guide is for users on Linux or MacOSX.

Before installation:
Run "./install --help" for available options and minimum system specs. The install options are
mostly same as the cmake options passed by the installation script to cmake. The installation
script does not check your system for minimum specs. It just tells you what it requires for
successful compilation. The checking is left up to the user.

To build and install:
Run the script "./install" in the project folder. For our project, we use a separate 'Build' 
folder to keep things clean between different builds. Since CMake is a pain when it comes to
automatically designate separate build folders through command line options, we use bash shell
script "install" to automate a clean build.

To clean:
Run "./cleanup --help" to view all cleanup options. Run the script "./cleanup" with available
options.
